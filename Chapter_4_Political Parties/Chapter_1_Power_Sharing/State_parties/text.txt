State parties



Other than these seven parties, most of the major parties of the country are classified by the
Election Commission as ‘State parties’. These are commonly referred to as regional parties. Yet
these parties need not be regional in their ideology or outlook. Some of these parties are all India
parties that happen to have succeeded only in some states. Parties like the Samajwadi Party and
Rashtriya Janata Dal have national level political organisation with units in several states. Some
of these parties like Biju Janata Dal, Sikkim Democratic Front, Mizo National Front and Telangana
Rashtra Samithi are conscious about their State identity.

Over the last three decades, the number and strength of these parties has expanded. This made the
Parliament of India politically more and more diverse. No one national party is able to secure on
its own a majority in the Lok Sabha, until 2014. As a result, the national parties are compelled to
form alliances with State parties. Since 1996, nearly every one of the State parties has got an
opportunity to be a part of one or the other national level coalition government. This has
contributed to the strengthening of federalism and democracy in our country. (See the De moc ra tic
