De moc ra tic Polit ics



Chapter 4 Overview In this tour of democracy, we have come across political parties several times.
In Class IX, we noticed the role of political parties in the rise of democracies, in the formation
of constitutional designs, in electoral politics and in the making and working of governments. In
this textbook, we have glanced at political parties as vehicles of federal sharing of political
power and as negotiators of social divisions in the arena of democratic politics.

Before concluding this tour, let us take a close look at the nature and working of political
parties, especially in our country. We begin by asking two common questions: Why do we need parties?
How many parties are good for a democracy? In the light of these, we introduce the national and
regional political parties in todayâ€™s India and then look at what is wrong with political parties
and what can be done about it.
