INCOME AND OTHER CRITERIA



What could these attributes be? Let us examine this through an example.

Table 1.3 gives the per capita income of Haryana, Kerala and Bihar.

Actually, these figures are of Per Capita Net State Domestic Product at Current Prices for 2021–22.
Let us ignore what this complicated term exactly means. Roughly, we can take it to be the per capita
income of the state. We find that of the three, Haryana has the highest per capita TABLE 1.4 SOME
COMPARATIVE DATA ON TABLE 1.3 PER CAPITA INCOME State Per Capita Income for 2021–22 (in Rs) Haryana
2,64,729 Kerala 2,34,405 Bihar 47,498 income and Bihar is at the bottom.

This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs 2,64,729 in one year whereas, on an
average, a person in Bihar earned only around Rs 47,500. So, if per capita income were to be used as
the measure of development, Haryana will be considered the most developed and Bihar the least
developed state of the three. Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to these states
given in Table 1.4.
