WHAT DEVELOPMENT PROMISES — DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT GOALS



Having filled Table 1.1, let us now examine it. Do all of these persons have the same notion of
development or progress? Most likely not. Each one of them seeks different things.

They seek things that are most important for them, i.e., that which can fulfil their aspirations or
desires.

In fact, at times, two persons or groups of persons may seek things TABLE 1.1 DEVELOPMENTAL GOALS OF
DIFFERENT Developmental Goals / Aspirations More days of work and better wages; local school is able
to provide quality education for their children; there is no social discrimination and they too can

conflicting. A girl expects as much freedom and opportunity as her brother, and that he also shares

industrialists may want more dams. But this may submerge the land and disrupt the lives of people
who are displaced – such as tribals. They might resent this and may prefer small check dams or tanks
to irrigate their land.

So, two things are quite clear: one, different persons can have different developmental goals and
two, what may be development for one may not be development for the other. It may even be
destructive for the other.
