2.5 Indian Entrepreneurs Abroad



Growing food and other crops for the world market required capital. Large plantations could borrow
it from banks and markets. But what about the humble peasant? Enter the Indian banker. Do you know
of the Shikaripuri Shroffs and Nattukottai Chettiars? They were amongst the many groups of bankers
and traders who financed export agriculture in Central and Southeast Asia, using either their own
funds or those borrowed from European banks. They had a sophisticated system to transfer money over
large distances, and even developed indigenous forms of corporate organisation.

Indian traders and moneylenders also followed European colonisers into Africa. Hyderabadi Sindhi
traders, however, ventured beyond European colonies. From the 1860s they established flourishing
emporia at busy ports worldwide, selling local and imported curios to tourists whose numbers were
beginning to swell, thanks to the development of safe and comfortable passenger vessels.
