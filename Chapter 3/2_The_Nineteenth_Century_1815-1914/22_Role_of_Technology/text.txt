2.2 Role of Technology



What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships, the telegraph, for example,
were important inventions without which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.

But technological advances were often the result of larger social, political and economic factors.
For example, colonisation stimulated new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply and quickly from faraway farms to
final markets.

The trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process.

Till the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe and then slaughtered when they
arrived there. But live animals took up a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill,
lost weight, or became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond the reach of the
European poor. High prices in turn kept demand and production down until the development of a new
technology, namely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable foods over long
distances.

Now animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point – in America, Australia or New Zealand –
and then transported to Europe as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered meat prices
in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume a more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread
and potatoes many, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs) to their diet. Better
living conditions promoted social peace within the country and support for imperialism abroad.
