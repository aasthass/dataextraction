4 Rebuilding a World Economy: The Post-war Era



The Second World War broke out a mere two decades after the end of the First World War. It was
fought between the Axis powers (mainly Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy) and the Allies (Britain,
France, the Soviet Union and the US). It was a war waged for six years on many fronts, in many
places, over land, on sea, in the air.

Once again death and destruction was enormous. At least 60 million people, or about 3 per cent of
the world’s 1939 population, are believed to have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result
of the war. Millions more were injured.

Unlike in earlier wars, most of these deaths took place outside the battlefields. Many more
civilians than soldiers died from war-related causes. Vast parts of Europe and Asia were devastated,
and several cities were destroyed by aerial bombardment or relentless artillery attacks. The war
caused an immense amount of economic devastation and social disruption. Reconstruction promised to
be long and difficult.

Two crucial influences shaped post-war reconstruction. The first was the US’s emergence as the
dominant economic, political and military power in the Western world. The second was the dominance
of the Soviet Union. It had made huge sacrifices to defeat Nazi Germany, and transformed itself from
a backward agricultural country into a world power during the very years when the capitalist world
was trapped in the Great Depression.
