4.2 The Early Post-war Years



The Bretton Woods system inaugurated an era of unprecedented growth of trade and incomes for the
Western industrial nations and Japan. World trade grew annually at over 8 per cent between 1950 and
1970 and incomes at nearly 5 per cent. The growth was also mostly stable, without large
fluctuations. For much of this period the unemployment rate, for example, averaged less than 5 per
cent in most industrial countries.

This is the place where the famous conference was held.

These decades also saw the worldwide spread of technology and enterprise. Developing countries were
in a hurry to catch up with the advanced industrial countries. Therefore, they invested vast amounts
of capital, importing industrial plant and equipment featuring modern technology.
