Chapter 3 Gender, Religion and Caste Overview The existence of social diversity does not threaten
democracy. Political expression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirable in a
democratic system. In this chapter we apply these ideas to the practice of democracy in India. We
look at three kinds of social differences that can take the form of social divisions and
inequalities. These are social differences based on gender, religion and caste. In each case we look
at the nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics.

We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences are healthy or otherwise in a
democracy.
