Chapter I Power-sharing Overview With this chapter, we resume the tour of democracy that we started
last year. We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not rest with any one organ of the
government. An intelligent sharing of power among legislature, executive and judiciary is very
important to the design of a democracy. In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea of
power-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri Lanka. Both these stories are
about how democracies handle demands for power-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions
about the need for power-sharing in democracy. This allows us to discuss various forms of power-
sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.
