Reduction of inequality and poverty



Perhaps more than development, it is reasonable to expect democracies to reduce economic
disparities. Even when a country achieves economic growth, will wealth be distributed in such a way
that all citizens of the country will have a share and lead a better life? Is economic growth in
democracies accompanied by increased inequalities among the people? Or do democracies lead to a just
distribution of goods and opportunities? © Ares - Best of Latin America, Cagle Cartoons Inc.

Democracies are based on political equality. All individuals have equal weight in electing
representatives.

Parallel to the process of bringing individuals into the political arena on an equal footing, we
find growing economic inequalities. A small number of ultra-rich enjoy a highly disproportionate
share of wealth and incomes. Not only that, their share in the total income of the country has been
increasing. Those at the bottom of the society have very little to depend upon. Their incomes have
been declining. Sometimes they find it difficult to meet their basic needs of life, such as food,
clothing, house, education and health.

In actual life, democracies do not appear to be very successful in reducing economic inequalities.
In Class IX Economics textbook, you have already studied about poverty in India. The poor constitute
a large proportion of our voters and no party will like to lose their votes. Yet democratically
elected governments do not appear to be as keen to address the question of poverty as you would
expect them to. The situation is much worse in some other countries.

In Bangladesh, more than half of its population lives in poverty. People in several poor countries
are now dependent on the rich countries even for food supplies.

Voice of the Poor Democracy is a rule of the majority. The poor are in majority. So democracy must
be a rule of the poor. How can this not be the case? De moc ra tic Polit ics World’s Wealth Owned by
