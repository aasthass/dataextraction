Overview 
As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to
move beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of expectations in real life? We
begin by thinking about how to assess the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think
on this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes of democracy in various
respects: quality of government, economic well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict
and finally freedom and dignity.
