4 Factories Come Up



The first cotton mill in Bombay came up in 1854 and it went into production two years later. By 1862
four mills were at work with 94,000 spindles and 2,150 looms. Around the same time jute mills came
up in Bengal, the first being set up in 1855 and another one seven years later, in 1862. In north
India, the Elgin Mill was started in Kanpur in the 1860s, and a year later the first cotton mill of
Ahmedabad was set up. By 1874, the first spinning and weaving mill of Madras began production.

Who set up the industries? Where did the capital come from? Who came to work in the mills?
