2.1 The Movement in the Towns



The movement started with middle-class participation in the cities.

Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges, headmasters and teachers
resigned, and lawyers gave up their legal practices. The council elections were boycotted in most
provinces except Madras, where the Justice Party, the party of the non-Brahmans, felt that entering
the council was one way of gaining some power â€“ something that usually only Brahmans had access to.

The effects of non-cooperation on the economic front were more dramatic. Foreign goods were
boycotted, liquor shops picketed, and foreign cloth burnt in huge bonfires. The import of foreign
cloth halved between 1921 and 1922, its value dropping from Rs 102 crore to Rs 57 crore. In many
places merchants and traders refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade. As the
boycott movement spread, and people began discarding imported clothes and wearing only Indian ones,
production of Indian textile mills and handlooms went up.

But this movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety of reasons. Khadi cloth was
often more expensive than mass- produced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it.

How then could they boycott mill cloth for too long? Similarly the boycott of British institutions
posed a problem. For the movement to be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to be set up
so that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were slow to come up. So students and
teachers began trickling back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in government
courts.
