2.3 Swaraj in the Plantations



Workers too had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi and the notion of swaraj. For plantation
workers in Assam, freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which
they were enclosed, and it meant retaining a link with the village from which they had come. Under
the Inland Emigration Act of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave the tea gardens
without permission, and in fact they were rarely given such permission. When they heard of the Non-
Cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the plantations and headed
home. They believed that Gandhi Raj was coming and everyone would be given land in their own
villages.

They, however, never reached their destination. Stranded on the way by a railway and steamer strike,
they were caught by the police and brutally beaten up. put to death by the British. Can you think of
a similar example from the national movement in Indo-China (Chapter 2)? The visions of these
movements were not defined by the Congress programme. They interpreted the term swaraj in their own
ways, imagining it to be a time when all suffering and all troubles would be over. Yet, when the
tribals chanted Gandhiji’s name and raised slogans demanding ‘Swatantra Bharat’, they were also
emotionally relating to an all-India agitation. When they acted in the name of Mahatma Gandhi, or
linked their movement to that of the Congress, they were identifying with a movement which went
beyond the limits of their immediate locality. violent clash with the police. Hearing of the
incident, Mahatma Gandhi called a halt to the Non-Cooperation Movement.
