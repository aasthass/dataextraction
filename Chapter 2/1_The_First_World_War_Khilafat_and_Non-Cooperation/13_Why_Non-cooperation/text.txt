1.3 Why Non-cooperation?



In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909) Mahatma Gandhi declared that British rule was established in
India with the cooperation of Punjab, 1919.

Nationalism in India people, or participate in activities, or buy and use things; usually a form of
protest Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate,
British rule in India would collapse within a year, and swaraj would come.

How could non-cooperation become a movement? Gandhiji proposed that the movement should unfold in
stages. It should begin with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a boycott of
civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils, schools, and foreign goods. Then, in
case the government used repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched.

Through the summer of 1920 Mahatma Gandhi and Shaukat Ali toured extensively, mobilising popular
support for the movement.

Many within the Congress were, however, concerned about the proposals. They were reluctant to
boycott the council elections scheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement might
lead to popular violence. In the months between September and December there was an intense tussle
within the Congress. For a while there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and the
opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at Nagpur in December 1920, a compromise
was worked out and the Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.

How did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did different social groups conceive of the
idea of Non-Cooperation? Foreign cloth was seen as the symbol of Western economic and cultural
domination.
