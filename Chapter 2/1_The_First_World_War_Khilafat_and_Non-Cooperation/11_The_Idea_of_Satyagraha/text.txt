Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in January 1915. As you know, he had come from South Africa where
he had successfully fought colonial state forced people to join the army November 1913.

Mahatma Gandhi was leading the workers from Newcastle to Transvaal. When the marchers were stopped
and Gandhiji arrested, thousands of more workers joined the satyagraha against racist laws that
denied rights to non-whites.

Nationalism in India the racist regime with a novel method of mass agitation, which he called
satyagraha. The idea of satyagraha emphasised the power of truth and the need to search for truth.
It suggested that if the cause was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force
was not necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or being aggressive, a
satyagrahi could win the battle through non- violence. This could be done by appealing to the
conscience of the oppressor. People – including the oppressors – had to be persuaded to see the
truth, instead of being forced to accept truth through the use of violence. By this struggle, truth
was bound to ultimately triumph. Mahatma Gandhi believed that this dharma of non-violence could
unite all Indians.

After arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi successfully organised satyagraha movements in various
places. In 1917 he travelled to Champaran in Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the
oppressive plantation system. Then in 1917, he organised a satyagraha to support the peasants of the
Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected by crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda
could not pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be relaxed. In 1918, Mahatma
Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organise a satyagraha movement amongst cotton mill workers.
