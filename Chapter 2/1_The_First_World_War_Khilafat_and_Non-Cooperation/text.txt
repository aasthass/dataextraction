1 The First World War, Khilafat and Non-Cooperation



In the years after 1919, we see the national movement spreading to new areas, incorporating new
social groups, and developing new modes of struggle. How do we understand these developments? What
implications did they have? First of all, the war created a new economic and political situation.

It led to a huge increase in defence expenditure which was financed by war loans and increasing
taxes: customs duties were raised and income tax introduced. Through the war years prices increased
– doubling between 1913 and 1918 – leading to extreme hardship for the common people. Villages were
called upon to supply soldiers, and the forced recruitment in rural areas caused widespread anger.

Then in 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India, resulting in acute shortages of
food. This was accompanied by an influenza epidemic. According to the census of 1921, 12 to 13
million people perished as a result of famines and the epidemic.

People hoped that their hardships would end after the war was over. But that did not happen.

At this stage a new leader appeared and suggested a new mode of struggle.
