Nationalism in India



As you have seen, modern nationalism in Europe came to be associated with the formation of nation-
states. It also meant a change in peopleâ€™s understanding of who they were, and what defined their
identity and sense of belonging. New symbols and icons, new songs and ideas forged new links and
redefined the boundaries of communities. In most countries the making of this new national identity
was a long process. How did this consciousness emerge in India? In India and as in many other
colonies, the growth of modern nationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial movement.

People began discovering their unity in the process of their struggle with colonialism. The sense of
being oppressed under colonialism provided a shared bond that tied many different groups together.

But each class and group felt the effects of colonialism differently, their experiences were varied,
and their notions of freedom were not always the same. The Congress under Mahatma Gandhi tried to
forge these groups together within one movement. But the unity did not emerge without conflict.

In an earlier textbook you have read about the growth of nationalism in India up to the first decade
of the twentieth century. In this chapter we will pick up the story from the 1920s and study the
Non- Cooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements. We will explore how the Congress sought to
develop the national movement, how different social groups participated in the movement, and how
nationalism captured the imagination of people.
