3 The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848



As conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism and nationalism came to be
increasingly associated with revolution in many regions of Europe such as the Italian and German
states, the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland. These revolutions were led by the
liberal-nationalists belonging to the educated middle-class elite, among whom were professors,
school- teachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.

The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830. The Bourbon kings who had been restored to
power during the conservative reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries
who installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its head. ‘When France sneezes,’
Metternich once remarked, ‘the rest of Europe catches cold.’ The July Revolution sparked an uprising
in Brussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

An event that mobilised nationalist feelings among the educated elite across Europe was the Greek
war of independence. Greece had been part of the Ottoman Empire since the fifteenth century. The
growth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle for independence amongst the
Greeks which began in 1821.

Nationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile and also from many West
Europeans who had sympathies for ancient Greek culture. Poets and artists lauded Greece as the
cradle of European civilisation and mobilised public opinion to support its struggle against a
Muslim empire. The English poet Lord Byron organised funds and later went to fight in the war, where
he died of fever in 1824. Finally, the Treaty of Constantinople of 1832 recognised Greece as an
independent nation.
