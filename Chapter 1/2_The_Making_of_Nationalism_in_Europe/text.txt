Nationalism in Europe In Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial production and
trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence of commercial classes whose existence was based on
production for the market. Industrialisation began in England in the second half of the eighteenth
century, but in France and parts of the German states it occurred only during the nineteenth
century. In its wake, new social groups came into being: a working-class population, and middle
classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.

In Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number till late nineteenth century. It
was among the educated, liberal middle classes that ideas of national unity following the abolition
of aristocratic privileges gained popularity.
