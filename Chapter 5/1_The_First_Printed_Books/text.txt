1 The First Printed Books



and Korea. This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594 onwards, books in China were printed by
rubbing paper – also invented there – against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both sides of the
thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional Chinese ‘accordion book’ was folded and
stitched at the side.

Superbly skilled craftsmen could duplicate, with remarkable accuracy, the beauty of calligraphy.

The imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major producer of printed material. China
possessed a huge bureaucratic system which recruited its personnel through civil service
examinations. Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast numbers under the sponsorship of
the imperial state. From the sixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up and
that increased the volume of print.

By the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the uses of print diversified. Print
was no longer used just by scholar- officials. Merchants used print in their everyday life, as they
collected trade information. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity.

The new readership preferred fictional narratives, poetry, autobiographies, anthologies of literary
masterpieces, and romantic plays. Rich women began to read, and many women began publishing their
poetry and plays. Wives of scholar-officials published their works and courtesans wrote about their
lives.

This new reading culture was accompanied by a new technology.

Western printing techniques and mechanical presses were imported in the late nineteenth century as
Western powers established their outposts in China. Shanghai became the hub of the new print
culture, catering to the Western-style schools. From hand printing there was now a gradual shift to
mechanical printing.
