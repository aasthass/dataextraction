EVERYDAY LIFE, CULTURE AND POLITICS



Print Culture It is difficult for us to imagine a world without printed matter. We find evidence of
print everywhere around us â€“ in books, journals, newspapers, prints of famous paintings, and also in
everyday things like theatre programmes, official circulars, calendars, diaries, advertisements,
cinema posters at street corners. We read printed literature, see printed images, follow the news
through newspapers, and track public debates that appear in print. We take for granted this world of
print and often forget that there was a time before print. We may not realise that print itself has
a history which has, in fact, shaped our contemporary world. What is this history? When did printed
literature begin to circulate? How has it helped create the modern world? In this chapter we will
look at the development of print, from its beginnings in East Asia to its expansion in Europe and in
India. We will understand the impact of the spread of technology and consider how social lives and
cultures changed with the coming of print.

Print Culture a n d the Modern World Chapter V Print Culture and the Modern World This is a royal
workshop in the sixteenth century, much before printing began in India. You can see the text being
dictated, written and illustrated. The art of writing and illustrating by hand was important in the
age before print. Think about what happened to these forms of art with the coming of printing
machines.
