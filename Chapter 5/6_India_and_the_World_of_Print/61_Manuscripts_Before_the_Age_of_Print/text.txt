6.1 Manuscripts Before the Age of Print



India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts â€“ in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian,
as well as in various vernacular languages.

Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper.

Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either pressed between wooden covers or
sewn together to ensure preservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after the
introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.

Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had to be handled carefully, and they
could not be read easily as the beautiful calligraphy and the elaborate illustration and design.
Manuscripts like this continued to be produced for the rich even after the coming of the
letterpress.

was produced in the eighteenth century in the Malayalam script. script was written in different
styles. So manuscripts were not widely used in everyday life. Even though pre-colonial Bengal had
developed an extensive network of village primary schools, students very often did not read texts.
They only learnt to write. Teachers dictated portions of texts from memory and students wrote them
down. Many thus became literate without ever actually reading any kinds of texts.
