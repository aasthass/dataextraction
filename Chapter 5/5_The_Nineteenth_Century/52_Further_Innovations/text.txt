5.2 Further Innovations



By the late eighteenth century, the press came to be made out of metal. Through the nineteenth
century, there were a series of further innovations in printing technology. By the mid-nineteenth
century, Richard M. Hoe of New York had perfected the power-driven cylindrical press. This was
capable of printing 8,000 sheets per hour.

This press was particularly useful for printing newspapers. In the late nineteenth century, the
offset press was developed which could print up to six colours at a time. From the turn of the
twentieth century, electrically operated presses accelerated printing operations.

A series of other developments followed. Methods of feeding paper improved, the quality of plates
became better, automatic paper reels and photoelectric controls of the colour register were
introduced.

The accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements transformed the appearance of printed
texts.

Printers and publishers continuously developed new strategies to sell their product. Nineteenth-
century periodicals serialised important novels, which gave birth to a particular way of writing
novels. In the 1920s in England, popular works were sold in cheap series, called the Shilling
Series. The dust cover or the book jacket is also a twentieth-century innovation. With the onset of
the Great Depression in the 1930s, publishers feared a decline in book purchases. To sustain buying,
they brought out cheap paperback editions.
