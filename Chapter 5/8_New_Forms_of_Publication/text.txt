8 New Forms of Publication



Printing created an appetite for new kinds of writing. As more and more people could now read, they
wanted to see their own lives, experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read.

The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally catered to this need. It soon
acquired distinctively Indian forms and styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience,
and gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.

Other new literary forms also entered the world of reading – lyrics, short stories, essays about
social and political matters. In different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives and
intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped such things.

By the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual culture was taking shape. With the setting up of
an increasing number of printing presses, visual images could be easily reproduced in multiple
copies. Painters like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass circulation. Poor wood engravers who
made woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and were employed by print shops. Cheap prints
and calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be bought even by the poor to decorate the
walls of their homes or places of work. These prints began shaping popular ideas about modernity and
tradition, religion and politics, and society and culture.

By the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being published in journals and newspapers, commenting
on social and political issues. Some caricatures ridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with
Western tastes and clothes, while others expressed the fear of social change. There were imperial
caricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as nationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule.

Raja Ravi Varma produced innumerable mythological paintings that were printed at the Ravi Varma
Press.
